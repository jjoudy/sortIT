Sort It is a website project made by students Jessica Joudy, Laurynn Diby, and Chelsea Fernandes for the Hack4Humanity 2019,
Sustainability. This website implements an image recognition system that can tell if the items in the image are recyclable, compostable, or
trash, as well as the type of material it is. We custom trained this image recognition software, hosted by Clarifai, using hundreds of
manually tagged and sorted photos in order to support this program.
